Or\r\nperhaps I will simply move on (maybe come back later). This particular\r\nproject is less about need or use and more about practicing Rust.\r\n\r\nMuch of the basic functionality is already present: can read a file or\r\ncommand output into the buffer, jump to any line using a very flexible\r\nline addressing scheme including regex search, and write files to disk.\r\n\r\nSome notable 'todo's that come to mind:\r\n* incorporate markers in arithmetic addressing (e.g. `'x+4,'x+5p` )\r\n* several commands and functions implemenenting them\r\n    create/change/remove marker\r\n    list lines\r\n    delete line(s)\r\n    substitution\r\n    join lines\r\n    move lines\r\n    print with line numbers\r\n    ... several others\r\n* complete invocation flags and parameters\r\n    \r\n\r\n",
