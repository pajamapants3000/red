* // and ?? repeat last search
* accept escaped '/' and '?' in fwd and rev regex searches, respectively
* accept any delimiter in sub commands, not just /
* organize code - particularly buffer methods
* add many more tests; would love to separate them if possible
* buffer should handle current address itself
* buffer should handle is_modified itself
* buffer should handle close (check is_modified, delete temp) itself

bugs
* undo reverts address back to first matching line on last global-type
command, rather than the address from which the global command was
executed
