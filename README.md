ed implementation in rust

Following the manpage for the OpenBSD version of ed, my intention
is to implement the same behavior and functionality present there.

Once this goal has been reached, I may consider developing further. Or
perhaps I will simply move on (maybe come back later). This particular
project is less about need or use and more about practicing Rust.

Most of the functionality has been implemented. The only major feature
remaining that comes to mind is undo. There is also a lot of cleaning
and testing still to be done.
