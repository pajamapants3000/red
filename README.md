# red
ed implementation in rust

I have recently discovered that "red" is a synonym for ed, I believe with
the "-r" (restricted) flag. So... I may want to change the name at some
point.

I have endeavored to implement the functionality of ed as described in the
OpenBSD ed man page.

The project is almost complete! Just some minor changes and improvements
I would still like to accomplish.

For usage information, see the OpenBSD ed man page. It can be found at:
