# RustEd
ed implementation in rust

I have recently discovered that "red" is a synonym for ed, I believe with
the "-r" (restricted) flag. So... I may want to change the name at some
point.

UPDATE: So I renamed the project to the oh-so-creative "RustEd". Hey, when
you're rewriting an application that already exists, with no innovations
or improvements or added features of any kind, a way too on-the-nose
name is probably appropriate. Save the creative, clever names for a
project that is actually somewhat original.

I have endeavored to implement the functionality of ed as described in the
OpenBSD ed man page.

The project is almost complete! Just some minor changes and improvements
I would still like to accomplish.

For usage information, see the OpenBSD ed man page. It can be found at:

  http://man.openbsd.org/ed.1

UPDATE: I tried running this on a Windows machine and it didn't work very
well. Should work pretty well on a \*Nix machine, I think.
This project is hardly complete, and I just don't have the time to follow
through at this point. Some day, perhaps, when I am able to start doing
some more work in Rust, I will come back and finish this as a way to get
back into the language. It was certainly a fun and challenging little
project.
