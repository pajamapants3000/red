<p>ed implementation in rust</p>

<p>Following the manpage for the OpenBSD version of ed, my intention
is to implement the same behavior and functionality present there.</p>

<p>Once this goal has been reached, I may consider developing further. Or
perhaps I will simply move on (maybe come back later). This particular
project is less about need or use and more about practicing Rust.</p>

<p>Much of the basic functionality is already present: can read a file or
command output into the buffer, jump to any line using a very flexible
line addressing scheme including regex search, and write files to disk.</p>

<p>Some notable 'todo's that come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>incorporate markers in arithmetic addressing (e.g. <code>'x+4,'x+5p</code> )</li>
<li>several commands and functions implemenenting them
create/change/remove marker
list lines
delete line(s)
substitution
join lines
move lines
print with line numbers
... several others</li>
<li>complete invocation flags and parameters</li>
</ul>
